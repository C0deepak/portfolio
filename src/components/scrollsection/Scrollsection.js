                <p>Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Deepak Kumar, your friendly mickey-mouse in the Disney land rocking the stage with CSS and dancing with JavaScript. It's like being in a playground where CSS is my favorite paint, and knowledge are my brushes, which are getting more experienced with the projects, and I'm loving every moment.</p>
                <p>But hey, the show goes on! ðŸš€ I'm a maestro in state-management, API handling, and have even touched the paintings with Headless-CMS. But guess what? The adventure doesn't stop there. I'm on a quest to become a Full Stack Web Developer, with MERN as my tool.</p>
                <p>Oh, and when I'm not crafting digital paintings, I'm painting with pixels in the graphic design world and also adding heat-maps ðŸ”¥ðŸ’» of LeetCode and GFGs to my list.</p>
                <p>Let's turn this tech journey into a wild ride together, where simplicity meets creativity, and every line of code is a step closer to building something extraordinary!</p>
